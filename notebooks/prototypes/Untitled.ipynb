       "  {'answer': \"In very very very basic terms it's the super dilution of ownership of a company. Stock is basically, well the stake of a company, broken up into tiny tiny pieces and put on the public market. Usually a board of directors own enough shares to control the company while the shares that go out on the market are called publicly traded shares. Say for example, you are a cannibal recipe website called Facecook and you as a private company have grown in popularity. You now need an injection of money to go to the next level and you don't want some huge investment firm controlling so much they could replace you. You break up your company's ownership into tiny shares, keep a majority for yourself, pass on some smaller amounts to your board of directors and your employees and the rest goes on the market. You set a reasonable valuation for it on the day it goes public, called the IPO or initial public offering. People all want a piece of the action, because they know if you do well, the stock value goes up (including that face cook stock you bought). Stock price goes up as demand goes up, or if there's rumors of something awesome you're doing. But in all honesty, most people on the public market are there as hawkers at a bazaar. Their aim is to buy at low prices and sell at high prices. The amount they get to own of your company is so little, they have little to no say in what your company does as an individual. But as a collective, every time there's Frenzy to buy, they drive your stock price up and inject capital into your company. EDIT (here's the part you were looking for): For individuals who play the game at the frenzied bazaar full time, they're all trying to hit gold. Have those few super massive successful trades that can make them millionaires in a matter of minutes. With thousands of people trading non stop around the world, values fluctuate like crazy. And provided you have the right mix and the right access to buy and sell stocks from the right company, you can make a killing (and lose it). When they scream sell sell sell, they want people to dump the stock because there's reason to believe it will drop. Once it bottoms out. They'll buy it again and sell it once it rises. It's like a manifestation of what nature is - an adrenaline fuelled chaotic race for survival over limited resources where wit, cunning and luck can all work in your favour or you can lose out despite 'doing everything right'\",\n",

       "  {'answer': 'Nowadays it\\'s almost entirely electronic. Traders submit orders into the exchange that are like \"I want to buy 100 shares of XYZ at $30,\" and as soon as someone is willing to sell at that price, the exchange informs both parties that the trade has occurred. The exchange will also list what the current highest \"bid\" and lowest \"ask\" are, so you\\'d see that someone is currently willing to buy 100 shares of XYZ for $30 and someone else is willing to sell 500 shares for $30.01. You can also submit a \"market order\" like \"sell 1000 shares to whomever will give me the best price,\" which in the above example might cause you to sell 100 shares to the guy bidding $30, then another 400 to some other guy bidding $29.99, and the last 500 to someone else bidding $29.98. The exchange will automatically figure out who owes what and handle the transactions. However, this was all much harder before computers. Instead of submitting your order automatically, you\\'d need to have someone on the floor of the exchange yelling about how much you wanted to buy/sell and the price. When you tried to buy stock for your personal account, your bank would then contact their floor trader to buy that stock for you. The pieces of paper were for writing down what trades that trader personally had done. When you\\'d see those people in movies, it\\'d be during major moves in the price, which would cause significant activity in the area and increase the general level of chaos. You might think \"why wouldn\\'t they lie about what happened?\" They could do that, but failing to follow through with a trade just because it ended up bad for you would destroy your reputation, and the rest of the traders would know and you\\'d never get trades again.',\n",

So to make a trade two people only need to agree on the price and the number of contracts. Those were negotiated by hand signals, so people wanting to buy would look around the room for someone signaling they wanted to sell, and when someone was found they\\'d flash some hand signals to establish the price and number of contracts. After that they would each fill out a piece of paper from their order book with the information from the trade. So one side\\'s paper would say, \"At specific time, I (broker 393) bought 10 contracts at a price of $3.47 per bushel from broker number 552\" and the other side\\'s paper would hopefully say \"At the same time, I (broker 552) sold 10 contracts at a price of $3.47 per bushel to broker 393.\" Then they would hand the papers to runners who would take them to an employee of the exchange. The exchange would match these papers and record that Broker 393\\'s account now has 10 more contracts and broker 552 has 10 fewer. There were occasionally errors, where perhaps two people think they bought from the same person, but they were pretty rare (everyone in the room paid a lot of money to be there, so no one wanted to make enough mistakes that they would lose their right to be there). So the papers are blank trade sheets, which become important when their filled out, and the shouting is an often futile attempt to get the attention of someone who you want to make a trade. Live stock market trading was done with specialists (one broker who would take the other side of every trade) who essentially created tiny areas where everyone might be trading a single stock. There was less risk of an error because the specialist was the only person who could trade with everyone. As you probably expect, specialists minted money for a very long time. Today computerized trading for almost all products is done on the same open outcry method, but the computer can record the transaction as it\\'s made and little need for shouting or hand signals.',\n",
